"Hello,

The job requirements do fit my profile but I'm not that sure I
would like to make the change. My current job is about the same
and I was more interested in changing my field to Machine Learning
rather than staying were I am. If you have any positions related to
this I would love to be considered. My profile has been updated
with the skills I've been acquiring to make this move.

I hope I can hear from you again if something else opens up. ",0,Ivan

The position matches my profile and the location 
is ideal. Unfortunately it does not meet my current
financial requirements. If the salary is not negotiable 
then I cannot accept. ",0,Ivan

Regarding the job opening, I don't think it would be a great fit for me at this time.

The job position looks interesting but I don't think I would

love to hear about them.",0,Ivan

The job description looks great but unfortunately
due to personal reasons I can't make the move at this time.
