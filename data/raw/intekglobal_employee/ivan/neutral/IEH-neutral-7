Hi,

Tho position mentions the need for 5+ years of experience in Java. Does the job require
server side java or will there be a lot of desktop application development? My
experience has been mainly towards mobile/web. On server side I've mainly worked with Go.

Is there freedom to choose the technologies we work with?
