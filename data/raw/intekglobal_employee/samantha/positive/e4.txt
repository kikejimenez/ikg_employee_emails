Hello Samantha,

My name is Lakshmi Tejeda, I have a master's 
degree in Chemistry with a bachelor's degree 
in Nanotechnology and software programming in high school.

I don't have a master's degree in physics or mathematics,
 but I have knowledge in both, from classical physics to
 quantum physics, also have knowledge in software 
programming languages of C ++ and Java.
And last but not least, mastery of the english language.

Best regards

MC. Lakshmi Tejeda
