Dear Samantha Medina,
I got your email from OCC after applying
for your job position,
  I leave you my updated CV attached,
I also wanted to tell you that I have two publications
  more pending for my JCR assestment and
  just I'm waiting for a date to present
  the PhD test (I was postponed for the
environmental contingency caused by COVID-19).
I would like to mention that although both my MsC and my PhD
they are in, they takes classes and subjects 100% mathematics
  in fact they were given to me in the department
of CINVESTAV mathematics by doctors from
training and postgraduate in mathematics and already in the
  PhD I took classes with physicists due to my subject
  related to fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.
Finally, I say goodbye, thanking you for your time.
Best regards,
Ottmar.
